> "Imagine a world where your writing and coding projects come to life with the help of a virtual assistant, ready to collaborate at every step. Sounds like science fiction? Well, it's not—it's Canvas by OpenAI."

## What is Canvas?

Have you ever wished for a tool that could seamlessly integrate into your creative process, offering suggestions and improvements as you work? Canvas is OpenAI's latest innovation, designed to transform how we interact with ChatGPT during writing and coding tasks. It's like having a co-pilot who not only helps navigate but also enhances the journey.

### Collaborative editing: Your new best friend

Think of Canvas as a digital workspace where collaboration is the star. It opens in a separate window, allowing you to highlight specific sections of text or code. Need feedback on a tricky paragraph or a complex line of code? Canvas has got you covered. It's like having a second pair of eyes, always ready to offer insights and suggestions.

## Inline feedback: instant gratification

Remember the last time you wished for immediate feedback on your work? With Canvas, you can receive inline suggestions for improvements, whether it's adjusting the length of your writing, changing the reading level, or debugging code. It's like having a personal editor and coder rolled into one, always ready to help you refine your masterpiece.

## Version control: because mistakes happen

We've all been there—making changes only to realize the previous version was better. Canvas includes a back button that lets you restore previous versions of your work. It's like having a time machine for your projects, giving you the freedom to experiment without fear.

## Coding support: a developer's dream

For those who live and breathe code, Canvas offers shortcuts to review code, add comments, insert logs, and fix bugs. Imagine having a coding buddy who never tires, always ready to help streamline your process. While Canvas doesn't execute code directly, it allows for direct interaction with the generated code, making it an invaluable tool for developers.

## Access and availability: who can use canvas?

Currently, Canvas is in beta for ChatGPT Plus and Team users, with plans to extend access to Enterprise and Education users starting October 10, 2024. Eventually, it will be available to free users once it exits the beta phase. To access Canvas, simply select the GPT-4o model from the model picker in ChatGPT.
