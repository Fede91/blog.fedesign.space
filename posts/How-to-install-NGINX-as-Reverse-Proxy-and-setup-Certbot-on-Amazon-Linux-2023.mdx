In the dynamic digital era, ensuring your site communicates via the HTTPS protocol is not only best practice — it’s required. NGINX is an agile web server known for its speed and reliability ([NGINX official documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/)). You have a solid foundation when combined with Certbot for certificate management. Let’s take a deep dive into configuring this dynamic duo on Amazon Linux 2023.

#### Disclaimer

We’re gearing up to install NGINX and Certbot for enlightening purposes. The configurations shared may need additional refinements for a robust production environment.

#### Prerequisites:

- A running AWS EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2023.
- A designated Elastic IP.

New to AWS? Here’s [how to launch an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) and [assign an Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).

### Install and setup NGINX

Establish an SSH connection with EC2 instance:

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/<PATH_TO_YOUR_PEM_FILE> ec2-user@<EC2_ELASTIC_IP>
```

Install NGINX and enable on startup:

```bash
$ sudo yum install nginx
$ sudo systemctl enable nginx && sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Want NGINX to act as a reverse proxy? Here’s your guide to set it up to listen on port 80 and direct traffic to a service operating on port 5555.

Access the NGINX configuration:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Change the value of YOUR_DOMAIN to the domain name connected with the EC2 instance (if any), and EC2_PRIVATE_IPV4_ADDRESS to the private IPv4 address of the EC2 instance, which can be retrieved via the AWS control panel:

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    listen       [::]:80;
    server_name  <YOUR_DOMAIN>;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://<EC2_PRIVATE_IPV4_ADDRESS>:5555;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Save the file, validate the configuration and reboot the service:

```bash
$ sudo nginx -t
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Security Concerns:

It is essential to secure NGINX. Here are some important pointers:

- Limit public access only to vital ports. AWS Security Groups documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) can guide.
- Deploy rate-limiting to deter DDoS attacks. Check [NGINX rate limiting](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/) for insights.
- Always update NGINX and server components. The [NGINX update guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/) can be handy.

### Enter, Certbot

For top-notch SSL/TLS security, Certbot is your ally. Let’s set it up:

1. Initialize a Python virtual environment:

```bash
$ sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/
$ sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
```

2. Install Certbot:

```bash
$ sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install certbot certbot-nginx
$ sudo ln -s /opt/certbot/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

3. Let Certbot work its magic on NGINX:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Following the certificate generation wizard, we will be able to access our EC2 instance via HTTPS using the address _https://EC2_ELASTIC_IP_ or _https://YOUR_DOMAIN_.

**Troubleshooting:**

- NGINX refusing to kick-off? Examine the error log: `$ sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`.
- Certbot errors? Validate DNS settings of your domain. Ensure port 80 is accessible. Certbot’s [official troubleshooting guide](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#problems-with-python-virtual-environment) can assist.
- Unexpected 502 errors? Your backend service might be down.

#### Automatic Renewal:

To allow Certbot to automatically renew certificates, just execute the following command to add a cron job:

```bash
$ echo "0 0,12 * * * root /opt/certbot/bin/python -c 'import random; import time; time.sleep(random.random() * 3600)' && sudo certbot renew -q" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab > /dev/null
```

### In Conclusion

You’ve just turbocharged your Amazon Linux 2023 instance with NGINX and Certbot, ensuring a secure and responsive web service. For continuous learning and exploration, ensure you frequently visit the official documentation of the tools you work with.
