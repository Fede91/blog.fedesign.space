_"Why settle for boring commit messages when AI can do the writing for you?"_

Have you ever stared at your terminal, fingers ready over the keyboard, trying to come up with the perfect commit message? We've all been there, right? Writing commit messages can be as exciting as watching paint dry. But what if I told you there's a way to automate this seemingly trivial yet crucial part of your development process? Interested? Read on!

## Say Hello to `aicommit`

Imagine having a virtual assistant that not only understands your code changes but also writes the perfect commit message for you. Enter [`aicommit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fede91/aicommit), a handy tool that uses OpenAI's GPT models to create thoughtful and relevant git commit messages. It's like having a mini Shakespeare in your terminal, minus the ruffles and quills.

```
